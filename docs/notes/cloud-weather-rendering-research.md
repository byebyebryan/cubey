# Cloud And Weather Rendering Research

This note captures the first implementation direction for Cubey clouds. It is
intended to keep the next project practical for game-style performance while
still being compatible with ocean high cameras and planet orbit views.

## References

- Unreal Engine Sky Atmosphere and Volumetric Clouds: use planet-scale sky
  parameters, separate cloud tracing quality from atmosphere setup, and expose
  shadow/reflection sample controls instead of treating clouds as a skybox.
- Unity HDRP Volumetric Clouds: drive cloud coverage from cloud maps and expose
  quality/temporal tradeoffs so a project can choose resolution and sample
  budget.
- Guerrilla/Nubis real-time cloud work: model clouds from authorable weather
  and density fields, then keep raymarching heavily budgeted through sparse
  sampling, lighting approximations, and temporal reuse.

## Direction

Clouds should not be folded into the clear-sky atmosphere shader. The shared
clear-sky atmosphere remains the base for sun, moon, sky color, exposure, and
environment lighting. Clouds are an additional weather layer with its own
coverage, density, shape, lighting, and shadow controls.

The first implementation should be a standalone `projects/clouds` pressure
project. It should consume the shared atmosphere solar-clock and lighting
foundation, but it should own cloud policy until the model is stable enough for
promotion into shared renderer code.

## Scale Model

Use one shared, planet-aware weather model with different render paths by camera
context:

- Surface: high-quality local view through a curved cloud layer, with horizon
  composition and cloud shadows.
- High altitude: camera may be inside or above the cloud layer and must be able
  to look down onto clouds.
- Orbit: render broad weather masses on a spherical cloud shell with lower local
  detail and strong terminator/shadow readability.

A flat slab is acceptable only as an internal debug simplification. The default
path should use a spherical shell from the start so ocean high cameras and
planet orbit captures do not become separate rewrites.

## Performance Rules

- Render clouds as a separate fullscreen pass at quarter, half, or full
  resolution; composite the result over the atmosphere background.
- Use bounded view and light sample counts tied to quality presets.
- Use single scattering, Beer transmittance, and a cheap edge/powder term before
  attempting expensive multiple scattering.
- Use early-out when transmittance gets low.
- Treat temporal accumulation as a quality/performance feature, reset when
  camera mode or major cloud parameters change.
- Do not raymarch clouds inside ocean or PBR material shaders. Consumers should
  sample composited sky/cloud output, a reflection/environment result, or a
  cloud shadow texture.

## Initial Contracts

The first shared vocabulary should stay small:

- weather map: coverage, type, density, wind, and storminess;
- cloud shell: planet radius, bottom altitude, top altitude, and layer flags;
- lighting: sun/moon direction and radiance from shared atmosphere/celestial
  state;
- outputs: sky/cloud color, approximate transmittance, cloud shadow factor, and
  debug views for weather, density, lighting, shadow, and step count.

Ocean and planet integration should wait until the standalone project proves the
surface, high-altitude, and orbit cases.

## V1 Validation Findings

The first standalone clouds checkpoint is useful as a pressure project, but it
is not ready to feed other renderers. The known blockers are:

- visible seams in the procedural cloud/weather field;
- awkward project-local controls instead of shared hierarchical/config-driven
  controls;
- no FPS/frame-time or raymarch workload diagnostics in the UI;
- recurrence of the atmosphere horizon band because the prototype owns a local
  sky/ground composition path.

Treat these as prerequisites for promotion. The likely next direction is a
seam-safe spherical weather/domain representation, shared performance and
config UI integration, and reuse of the fixed shared atmosphere composition
path instead of duplicating sky composition inside the cloud shader.

The second clouds checkpoint adds the first seam-safe spherical weather domain,
shared performance UI, and explicit prototype composition terms for background
atmosphere, procedural ground, cloud alpha, and cloud-shell ray coverage. That
makes the horizon band and shell framing diagnosable inside the standalone
project. The reduced-resolution rule above still needs a real offscreen cloud
target and composite pass before quality presets reduce rendered pixels.
